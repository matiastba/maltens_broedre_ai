This repository contains a wide range of methods to determine profound information regarding the world renowned beer guild "Maltens Brødre." 

# "Godt-og-vel AI"
The main purpose of this contribution to the world is the "Godt-og-vel AI". The "Godt-og-vel AI" ensures that Maltens Brødre will survive in the tragic event that our beloved Brother Holmberg should pass on to the everlasting beer fields. To get your own personal "Godt-og-vel AI" you simply need to clone this project to your computer, enter your group evalutation of a beer and let Broder Holmbergs digital representation do his magic.

As you type more evaluations of beers, the AI will enter a more and more 'drunken state' as would be the case for the living version of Brother Holmberg and become less accurate with every input. 

It is the general perception that Brother Holmberg will stay amongst the living for at least the next 10 years to come, in which time the "Godt-og-vel AI" is expected to become powerful enough to be a true representaion of Brother Holmberg.
